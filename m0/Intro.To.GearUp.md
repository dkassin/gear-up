## Gear Up Pre-Work

_Our **mission** is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers._

### What is the purpose of Gear Up in Mod 0?

* Reflect on intersectionality and how your identity impacts your experiences and interactions with others
* Develop greater empathy and awareness of the experiences of others in the field of software development

### Pre-Work Preparation
#### Background Knowledge

Step 1: Watch this video from Google. 
* ["Unconconscious Bias at Work"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW5s_-Nl3JE)

Step 2: If you are unfamiliar with the term "Implicit Bias," take time to read this article to build your background knowledge. 
* ["PBS News Hour: Implicit Bias"](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/making-people-aware-of-their-implicit-biases-doesnt-usually-change-minds-but-heres-what-does-work)

#### Reflect
Create a gist on Github and reflect (4-6 sentences) on the following questions:

* What were your reflections from the video?
  - I thought the video was quite interesting, especially the part that mentioned the bias people have when they design a product. I never really thought about the fact that when a product is designed for a specific user, it is usually incorrect. I can see how this is incredibly important both in coding and in product design. 
* In what ways have you examined your implicit biases before coming to Turing?
  - I never really took the time to examine my implicit biases before coming to Turing. It is definitely something I will need to reflect more on. 
* What kind of software do you imagine building in the future? How will understanding biases (or avoiding understanding biases) impact your products?
  - I hope to build software that is able to reach a broad user base. I think it would be very rewarding to have software that i've built being used in various parts of the world. I feel like it would be incredibly important to understand biases when trying to market products to a global audience because of the need to try and make something universal that appeals to many differnt cultures. 

#### READ

If you are unfamiliar with the term "Intersectionality," take time to read this article to understand the theory and introduction of the concept. If you are familiar, move to the reflection questions.  
* ["What's Intersectionality? Let These Scholars Explain the Theory and Its History"](https://time.com/5560575/intersectionality-theory/)

#### Reflect
On your same gist, reflect on the following quesitons:

<b>“All of us live complex lives that require a great deal of juggling for survival,” Carty and Mohanty said in an email. “What that means is that we are actually living at the intersections of overlapping systems of privilege and oppression.”</b>

 * When you consider the way you move through the world, what elements of your identity are you most aware of on a daily basis?
 - I would say that my gender and my age are the most apparent element of my identity that i'm most are of on a daily basis. I also am aware of the my ethnic identity, but I believe that in Colorado that is less of an issue compared to when I lived in Dallas.
 * What strengths does your identity give you?  How will you utilize those at Turing?
 - I would say that my identity gives me strength in that it allowed me to have some experiences that I would not normally have. I feel like at turing,students being able to provide their personal experiences is what makes the Turing education so impactful. 
 * How do you think you could value the identies of those around you to bring out their strengths at Turing? Has there been a time where you were able to advocate or include people around you?
 - I think the best way to bring out the identities of those around you is to just listen. I try to include people around me on a daily basis, even if its saying hello in the elevator. The best times i've had have been when people from all different backgrounds are together. 
 * How will your strengths impact you as a teammate?  What will you bring to your cohort? 
I think my strengthes of listening and trying to be inclusive allows me to be a good teammate because effective communication is the foundation of any great team. I hope to bring a different perspective to my cohort, coming from a trading background and also my experience living in multiple countries.
